				InSpaceHigh = Travelling through deep space gives you a lot of time to sit around and think. You wonder what they're doing back home. Not your home. Kerbin.

			}
			
		}

			{
				SrfLanded = It'd be pretty easy to bury the spacecraft under some of the smaller chunks.

		Body
		{
			name = WW/Wers
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = The horizon on this tiny world is so much closer than it ought to be--you feel mislead.

			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Vizea
			Values
			{
				InSpace = The surface is fairly rugged from up here, you watch carefully to pick out a good landing site--the steep slopes in the middle latitudes may not be the best bet.

			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = The big gray oval of Mesbin, surrounded by the dots and circles of its moons, is quite the sight.

				SrfLandedPolarMetal = It'd be easier to stick to the ground if we had a big magnet.
				SrfLandedPolarRust = The apparent gravity here completely disagrees with the angle of the surface. Centrifugal force is a hell of a thing.

				InSpaceLow = Orbital velocity here is pretty minuscule.

		Body
		{
			name = WW/Graymun
			Values
			{
				InSpace = You look down at the cold gray surface. It looks really beat up with craters.
				InSpace = You survey the gray moon from space, looking for a decent landing site. The maria seem like the best bet.

				SrfLandedMaria = Cabin temperature is rising, the air conditioning is having a tough time keeping up.
				SrfLandedMidlands = Internal conditions here are nominal. You feel a bit heavy, but perhaps that's just because you've been slacking off in low gravity for a while.
				SrfLandedContinents = Internal conditions here are nominal. You feel a bit heavy, but perhaps that's just because you've been slacking off in low gravity for a while.
				SrfLandedHighlands = Internal conditions here are nominal. You feel a bit heavy, but perhaps that's just because you've been slacking off in low gravity for a while. You notice that the indicator light for the heater has been flickering.

			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Manonam
			Values
			{
				SrfLanded = You think you just saw another minor moon out of the window.

			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Lito

			}
		}
		Body
		{

			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = The spinning world below is fairly disorienting. You figure it's best to navigate by the stars.
				InSpaceLow = Yawer's terrain rolls by at a slow speed, but make no mistake, by small moon standards you're orbiting quite rapidly.

				InSpaceHigh = As you drift between the planets, you reflect on the nature of Kerbalkind and what they are doing in deep space.
				InSpaceHigh = You realize, with dread, that you have forgotten your toothbrush. It's a long time until you can find it again.
				InSpaceHigh = Travelling through deep space being the intensely boring subject it is, you record in your log that the situation is more or less nominal, and get back to your game of computer-aided 3D Multi-Chess with Mission Control and the other astronauts. At this distance, the lag time is getting pretty annoying. Maybe you can start your own 3D Multi-Chess game.
				InSpaceHigh = Travelling through deep space gives you a lot of time to sit around and think. You wonder what they're doing back home. Not your home. Kerbin.
				InSpaceHigh = You write down some visual observations of Gememma--with protection of course--and sketch out the features you see.

				LowelInSpaceHigh = You watch Lowel and Ollym carefully, taking note of their respective features and appearances. Ollym is a fairly normal looking desert planet--though covered in huge bumpy mountains, but Lowel is particularly strange.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Gannovar
			Values
			{
				InSpaceHigh = Gannovar is a phenomenal off-white and blue marble hanging in the sky below you.

				SrfSplashedRiftWaters = A boat would be a good idea here.
				SrfSplashedEquatorialOcean = The spacecraft is rated for several atmospheres of pressure, but you're not sure how many oceans it's rated for.
				SrfSplashedOceanHotspots = There's a distinct lack of glaciers in these waters. It must be significantly warmer. You realize that this is one of two spots where Gememma is directly overhead at periapsis, due to its spin-locked rotation.
			}
		}
		Body
		{
			name = WW/Ollym
			Values
			{
				InSpace = Ollym is a fairly normal looking desert planet--or it would be, were it not for the huge roughly circular bulges covering its surface.
