			description = The second minor planet of the Kaywell system to be discovered. Its existence was firmly suspected after a terminally ill solar astronomer Bilburry Kerman detected a faint, tiny transiting object. After calculating a possible trajectory, he realized that there would be no more transits before he was likely to die, and that several decades later it would transit the disk of Shol. Several telescope cameras were burnt out trying to find the asteroid before the transit, and so Bilburry was able to see his asteroid confirmed before he died unrelatedly in the tragedy of the Terrible Bigsity City Depressurization Event.
