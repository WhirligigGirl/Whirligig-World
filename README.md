BACKSTORY

Around 1300 years ago, explorers from the far off planet Kerbin left their home to colonize other star systems. One such ship embarked on a journey to Kerbmun, an oxygenated moon in the Kaywell star system. There was just one problem. They hadn't counted on Mesbin being much wider than expected.

Unable to correct their course due to piloting error, the U.S.C. Magnificent Desolation crashed into the massive, 70 Kerbin Mass planet Mesbin. Luckily, Mesbin spins. Once every twenty eight minutes it completes a rotation, and the centripetal effect pushes the equator outwards and negates some of the gravity. The 13 gees of gravity at the poles is reduced to a tad under 1.3 gee at the equator.

The payload of the ship survived, but the engines and fuel tanks were reduced to a lot of metal rubble along the surface. Unable to find somewhere else to go, they buried themselves underground and set up a stable ecosystem and environment. It took nearly two millenia, a few wars, and the re-invention of the steam engine, but eventually the colony was sufficiently industrialized to start looking up again.

------------------------------------------------------------------

CAREER AND SCIENCE MODE NOTES:

* It is refreshing to play in this system if you're already used to career mode.
* You should definitely try this in career mode--I've had a lot of fun with this!
* The tech tree has been reconfigured to make more sense: 
    * The tall rocket tanks for Size 1 and Size 1.5 are unlocked at the same time as the short tanks.
    * Aviation sub-tree is moved one space to the right, unlocking later and requiring more science for each node.
    * Field Science Node is now where Aviation was before--rovers before planes!
    * Science cost and node connections have been rearranged appropriately to fit.
    * Changed Survivability from basic landing parts to the first antennas and some probe bits and renamed it "Safety Equipment". It's survivable because now you can use robots instead of kerbals.
    * Changed Stability icon from a winglet to the flight control icon, along with a few other icon changes.
    * Landing node now contains the small parachute, the radial drogue chute, and the radial parachute, as well as all heat shields up to 2.5m.
    * Unlock monopropellant and the linear RCS thruster in Stability.
    * Both the radial decoupler and the 1.25m decoupler are unlocked in tier 2: Basic Rocketry and Engineering 101 respectively.
    * Thermometer and Mystery Goo swap places.
    * Barometer is unlocked earlier--and rebranded as AtMoCo surplus cavern pressure sensors from a cave-city that lost all its air due to a tragic mistake.
    * Added the Kaptunik, which is very heavy and lacks the internal antenna, BUT it does have full SAS autopilot (Prograde/Retrograde, Radial In/Out, Antinormal/Normal, Full Thrust/Cut Thrust, and Stage.) When you unlock the antenna you of course get all of that and manual control, but it's still really heavy.
    * The small ISRU parts are unlocked earlier, so you can take advantage of mining asteroids earlier on.
    * Pods and Lander Cans have been swapped around.
    * Tricoupler and Bicoupler are unlocked early on as well.
* Making History compatible, partially compatible with other mods.
* All transmitter parts now have 2 times the range.
* All bodies have biome maps, some more detailed than others.
* Most worlds have fairly detailed science descriptions. (Though writing dozens of experiements for many biomes on 50 bodies necessarily means not every world and situation will be as fleshed out as possible)
* The atmosphere analysis experiment will simply display the atmospheric composition that was used to generate atmosphere curves.
* Science has been balanced such that the total amount of science available in the system is greater than the stock system, but each individual celestial body is worth less science than their stock equivalents.

These changes only affect the Mesbin homeworld option.

------------------------------------------------------------------

KAPUTNIK PROBE CORE:

The Kaputnik Mk0 Electromechanical Program Executor and Four-Function Calculator! A start-level probe core designed by me and modeled by NovaSilisko that is 1.875m diameter (1.25m mounting points), very heavy, and contains all SAS levels. However, there's no transmitter/reciever, so the probe core can *only* use SAS for control until you unlock the antenna. Even when you do finally get the antenna and full control over the vehicle, and therefore have all the functionality of the top tier probe cores, you still have to lug that functionality around in a 1.2 ton mass of vacuum tubes, wires, metal gears and cogs.

------------------------------------------------------------------

KNOWN ISSUES:

* Kaywell and Gememma can be seen behind the equatorial bulge of Mesbin. This is inherent stock behavior--look for the sun lens flare behind a lump on Gilly or Bop.
* Mesbin has an atmosphere that goes all the way up past the equatorial bulge. It is not functional, but is required for making engines work (Isp scaling) and for Career mode contracts. As of 0.10.0, the extra height can be disabled in a settings file, at the expense of ruining the first few contracts.
* Mesbin's shape is also not accurate to what the game insists is "down" as far as the camera works. So the middle latitudes will always appear to slope much more than their effective gravity would imply.
* There are some issues with reparenting Kerbin using Kerbmun Homeworld swap. The orbit of the planet may appear to wander, and the Space Center scene will never be accurate.
* EVE-Redux Emissives are currently broken.
------------------------------------------------------------------

KERBMUN HOMEWORLD SWAP

There is a settings file that allows you to relocate the KSC to the surface of Kerbmun instead of Mesbin. I don't know *why* you would want to (since Mesbin is so dang cool), but just in case you're feeling homesick but want to play with the Kaywell system, this is an option. To use it, follow these instructions:

1 Open the file GameData/WhirligigWorld/Settings.cfg in a text editor.

2 You will see a configuration string with "Homeworld = Mesbin"

3 Change "Mesbin" to "Kerbmun"

4 Restart KSP, and make sure to use a new save file or at least back up your old one.

5 Kerbmun is nearly identical to Kerbin, though slightly denser. Gameplay will be comparable to Alternis Kerbol or Laythe Space Program.

----------------------------

OTHER USEFUL MODS (that are neither supported nor broken by WW)

The entire Near Future Suite, but in particular:
Near Future Exploration. Adds multiple large antenna systems for communication with the outer system, implemented in a unique and interesting way. Also lots of cool probe bodies to play with.
Near Future Electrical. Adds nuclear reactors to allow for power generation in the outer system. Pairs well with Near Future Propulsion.
Near Future Launch Vehicles. Giant rockets for a giant planet.
* Forum Thread: https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/155465-111x-near-future-technologies-all111x/

Cryogenic Engines. Energetic upper stages are good news for getting things out of Mesbin's deep gravity well.
* Forum Thread: https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/106089-145-cryogenic-engines-high-isp-chemical-rockets-august-7/

Kerbal Atomics. High efficiency and high thrust nuclear thermal rocket engines are kind of OP--except when you're trying to escape Mesbin's gravity well!
* Forum Thread: https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/130503-145-kerbal-atomics-fancy-nuclear-engines-august-7/

Eve Optimized Engines. Not useful for launching from Mesbin, but there are several destination planets with thick atmospheres that this may come in handy for.
* Forum Thread: https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/136342-14x-13x-eve-optimized-engines/

Transfer Window Planner. There is currently no delta-v chart (and probably won't be until I finalize the system design in 1.0). This mod is a lovely alternative, with plenty of information on transfer times and delta-v.
* Forum Thread: https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/84005-14x-transfer-window-planner-v1630-march-18/

Kerbal Engineer Redux. You should know what this does already! It's as useful here as ever. Displays information about crafts and celestial bodies. TWR displayed is relative to polar gravity for Mesbin, which is about 10 times higher than the apparent equatorial gravity, so keep that in mind when building.
* Github Repository: https://github.com/jrbudda/KerbalEngineer/releases

Waterfall. New shader for KSP rocket plumes. Changes rocket engine exhaust to look different in a vacuum compared to in the atmosphere, by showing the broader expansion of exhaust gasses.
* Forum Thread: https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/196309-111x-waterfall-a-framework-for-continuous-mesh-driven-engine-effects-march-26/

Better Timewarp. Adds better timewarp controls including faster maximum timewarp, which is necessary when maneuvering around the outer system.
* Forum Thread: https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/154935-15-bettertimewarpcontinued-customizable-time-warp-and-lossless-physics-warp/

SMURFF. Simple Module adjUstments for Real-ish Fuel-mass Fractions. It makes rocket parts lighter, so that stock parts can be used in Real Solar System instead of Realism Overhaul. However, it may be useful here given Mesbin's high escape velocity! I personally don't use it, but if you feel that WW is too hard with default mass ratios, you may want to give SMURFF a try!
